### VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
AWS VPC ressembles a traditional on-premise data center. We can launch resources in VPC. We can control how our network and the Amazon EC2 resources inside our network are exposed to the Internet.

VPC is completely owned by us.

AWS supports CIDR block from /16 onwards. For example
- 10.0.0.0/16
- 10.0.0.0/24
- 172.16.0.0/16
- 192.168.0.0/24
