### Conditional expressions
It is same as if condition in traditional scripting/programming languages.
```
if(expression){
    this will run if expression is true
}
else{
    this will run if expression is false
}
```
in terraform we write condition like
```
condition ? this will run if condition is true : this will run if condition is false
```
